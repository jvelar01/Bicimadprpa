# Bicimadprpa
practica Bicimad

This is the Bicimad assignment by Pablo Fernández, Gabriel Alba amd Joaquín Velarde.

In the folder datos we have placed the recopilation of all the data we have obtained. In the folder "programa" we have the script with the code 
and a subfolder bicimad_data in which the user must put the months in json format he or she wants to analyze. 

the file memoria.pdf is the written part of the project, in which we explain how the code works, its goals, and we analyze the results.
